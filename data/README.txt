In this foulder there are data obtained by simulation of different experiments on the prototype.

This directory is organized in the following way:
    - node1/
        - max_rate=2/ (Contains data for experiment for function with max_rate = 2)
        - max_rate=3/ (Contains data for experiment for function with max_rate = 3)
    - node2/
    - node3/

The "node1" directory contains data gather by a node of type "1". Same for "node2" and "node3".
    - Nodes of type 1 has 2 Gb of RAM and 1 virtual CPU (on VirtualBox).
    - Nodes of type 2 has 4 Gb of RAM and 2 virtual CPU (on VirtualBox).
    - Nodes of type 3 has 6 Gb of RAM and 4 virtual CPU (on VirtualBox).
